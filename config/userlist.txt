;; PgBouncer User Authentication File
;; This is a template - the actual file is generated by Terraform

;; Format: "username" "password_hash"
;; The password hash should be MD5 format: md5 + md5(password + username)

;; Example (replace with your actual credentials):
"postgres" "md5your_md5_hash_here"

;; How to generate the hash:
;; 1. Calculate: md5(password + username)
;; 2. Prepend "md5" to the result
;; 
;; Example with password "mypassword" and username "postgres":
;; echo -n "mypasswordpostgres" | md5sum
;; Result: 1234567890abcdef... (your hash will be different)
;; Final format: "postgres" "md51234567890abcdef..."

;; For security in production:
;; - Use strong passwords
;; - Limit user permissions in PostgreSQL
;; - Use SSL connections
;; - Consider certificate-based authentication

;; Multiple users example:
; "appuser" "md5hash_for_appuser"
; "readonly" "md5hash_for_readonly"
; "admin" "md5hash_for_admin"
